This prototype demonstrates friction-less goods delivery protocol which uses the network of untrusted carriers. This allows zero-cost on-boarding (no need to verify the identity of person), high elasticity to meet the demand spikes, still keeping business operations secure. Escrow smart-contract guarantees ensurance and gives strong economical incentive for parties to behave honestly. Contracts deployed on PlasmaPay mainnet but any blockchain supporting arbitrary code execution can be used with the same principles.
